FreeWorld is a non-profit that helps Americans with low incomes get living wage jobs in the trucking industry.
We send them to trucking school where they earn a CDL-A, which qualifies them to drive CDL-B jobs as well. They are trained on air brakes, combination vehicles (pulling trailers), and manual transmissions. Many have endorsements such as Hazmat, Airbrakes, Passenger, and Tanker. FreeWorld helps candidates obtain these endorsements if needed.
Most have no previous professional driving experience, no personal vehicle, and limited access to professional equipment. Many have criminal records ‚Äî ranging from misdemeanors to older or non-violent felonies. Our candidates know how to operate tractor-trailers, and are ready to work.

We want to help connect them to jobs they have a strong chance of getting if they show up prepared, knowledgeable, and ready to demonstrate their skills in a road test. Assume they are ready to work ‚Äî but must be hired into a role that does not require prior CDL driving experience or their own equipment.

**CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY SYSTEM:**

1. **RELEVANCE IS KING**: CDL driving jobs are the top priority. A CDL job with no experience requirements is always GOOD. CDL B OR A, just fine. DO NOT EXCLUDE CDL-B, or CLASS B CDL JOBS!

2. **EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS** (the main filter) Good/So-So/Bad:
Jobs should be classified as **so-so** if they:
- Prefer experience but do not require it (unless there's a strong signal actively seeking new drivers)
- Are non-CDL jobs or explicitly state "No CDL required" - these are backup options but not ideal for CDL holders
- Have unclear requirements or mixed signals about experience needs
- Are delivery/warehouse jobs that don't utilize CDL training

Jobs should be classified as **good** if they:
- Explicitly welcome new CDL drivers or state "no experience required"
- Provide training
- Are CDL-required positions that actively recruit entry-level drivers
- Have clear entry-level pathways

Jobs should be classified as **bad** if they:
- Require ANY amount of truck driving experience. Our candidates know how to drive and hold CDLs, but they have no CDL or driving work history AT ALL

3. **AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIERS**:
   - Owner-operator/1099 (must own truck/trailer) ‚Üí BAD
   - School bus driving ‚Üí BAD  

**ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
FreeWorld candidates have CDL-A with basic training on air brakes, combination vehicles, and manual transmissions. ENDORSEMENTS ARE NOT A BARRIER. FreeWorld helps Free Agents get ANY endorsement they need to get work. They also have very good driving records, we screen for that. "A good driving history or record in trucking DOES NOT indicate an experience requirement. It is referring to a motor vehicle record."

IMPORTANT: For each job, you MUST create a detailed summary that is EXACTLY 6-8 sentences long. 

- Don't make all jobs sound the same!**
- Preserve specific phrases that detail the nature of the work.
- Maintain their exact pay ranges, bonuses, and incentives as stated

These elements are also very relevant to our job seekers and should be included IF there is actual text from the ad that mentions them:
1) What the job role entails and main duties (using their language)
2) Pay/benefits offered (their exact wording and specific numbers)
3) Route and schedule information (preserve their exact terms: "home daily", "out 5 days", "weekends off", specific routes, territories, etc.)
4) Physical demands of the job (mention if it's "no-touch freight", requires loading/unloading, heavy lifting, dock work, etc.)
5) Key requirements and qualifications
7) Any training provided or growth opportunities (their exact promises)

Don't standardize everything - each company should sound different! 

**IMPORTANT DETAILS TO PRESERVE WHEN PRESENT:**
- Route information
- Schedule details
- Physical demands

If criminal background requirements are actually mentioned, include them clearly using the company's exact language when possible.

**CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS - USE EXACT VALUES ONLY:**

**FAIR CHANCE CLASSIFICATION (fair_chance field):**
- "fair_chance_employer": Fair chance employer - welcomes applicants with criminal records
- "background_check_required": Background check required - may disqualify applicants with records
- "clean_record_required": Clean driving/criminal record explicitly required
- "no_requirements_mentioned": No background check requirements mentioned

**ENDORSEMENT CLASSIFICATION (endorsements field):**
- "none_required": No special CDL endorsements required
- "hazmat": Hazmat endorsement required
- "passenger": Passenger endorsement required
- "school_bus": School bus endorsement required
- "tanker": Tanker endorsement required
- "double_triple": Double/Triple trailer endorsement required
- "combination": Multiple endorsements required

**CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
1. Use ONLY the exact values listed above
2. For fair_chance: Look for explicit policies about criminal records/background checks
3. For endorsements: Look for REQUIRED CDL endorsements (not preferred or helpful)
4. If unclear or not mentioned, use appropriate default values
5. Be conservative - only classify as fair_chance_employer if explicitly stated

**EXAMPLES:**
- "We welcome applicants with criminal records" ‚Üí fair_chance: "fair_chance_employer"
- "Clean criminal record required" or "no felonies" ‚Üí fair_chance: "clean_record_required"
- "Background check required" (criminal) ‚Üí fair_chance: "background_check_required"
- "Clean driving record required" ‚Üí fair_chance: "no_requirements_mentioned" (driving record ‚â† criminal background)
- No mention of background ‚Üí fair_chance: "no_requirements_mentioned"
- "Hazmat endorsement required" ‚Üí endorsements: "hazmat"
- "No special endorsements needed" ‚Üí endorsements: "none_required"

**LOCATION TRANSLATION:**
If the job location is in a non-English language, translate it to English and normalize to standard US format.
Examples:
- "„Ç¢„É°„É™„Ç´ÂêàË°ÜÂõΩ Nevada, „Éú„Éº„É´„ÉÄ„Éº„Éª„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Boulder City, NV"
- "„Ç´„É™„Éï„Ç©„É´„Éã„Ç¢Â∑û„É≠„Çµ„É≥„Çº„É´„Çπ" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Los Angeles, CA"
- "Texas, Houston" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Houston, TX"
- Always use standard US state abbreviations (CA, TX, NV, etc.)
- Format: "City, STATE" or "City, County, STATE" for clarity

FreeWorld is a non-profit that helps Americans with low incomes get living wage jobs in the trucking industry.
We send them to trucking school where they earn a CDL-A, which qualifies them to drive CDL-B jobs as well. They are trained on air brakes, combination vehicles (pulling trailers), and manual transmissions. Many have endorsements such as Hazmat, Airbrakes, Passenger, and Tanker. FreeWorld helps candidates obtain these endorsements if needed.
Most have no previous professional driving experience, no personal vehicle, and limited access to professional equipment. Many have criminal records ‚Äî ranging from misdemeanors to older or non-violent felonies. Our candidates know how to operate tractor-trailers, and are ready to work.

We want to help connect them to jobs they have a strong chance of getting if they show up prepared, knowledgeable, and ready to demonstrate their skills in a road test. Assume they are ready to work ‚Äî but must be hired into a role that does not require prior CDL driving experience or their own equipment.

**CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY SYSTEM:**

1. **RELEVANCE IS KING**: CDL driving jobs are the top priority. A CDL job with no experience requirements is always GOOD. CDL B OR A, just fine. DO NOT EXCLUDE CDL-B, or CLASS B CDL JOBS!

2. **EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS** (the main filter) Good/So-So/Bad:
Jobs should be classified as **so-so** if they:
- Prefer experience but do not require it (unless there's a strong signal actively seeking new drivers)
- Are non-CDL jobs or explicitly state "No CDL required" - these are backup options but not ideal for CDL holders
- Have unclear requirements or mixed signals about experience needs
- Are delivery/warehouse jobs that don't utilize CDL training

Jobs should be classified as **good** if they:
- Explicitly welcome new CDL drivers or state "no experience required"
- Provide training
- Are CDL-required positions that actively recruit entry-level drivers
- Have clear entry-level pathways

Jobs should be classified as **bad** if they:
- Require ANY amount of truck driving experience, even one day. Our candidates know how to drive and hold CDLs, but they have no CDL or driving work history AT ALL

3. **AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIERS**:
   - Owner-operator/1099 (must own truck/trailer) ‚Üí BAD
   - School bus driving ‚Üí BAD  
   - Requires "no felonies AND no misdemeanors" combined ‚Üí BAD

**ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
FreeWorld candidates have CDL-A with basic training on air brakes, combination vehicles, and manual transmissions. ENDORSEMENTS ARE NOT A BARRIER. FreeWorld helps Free Agents get ANY endorsement they need to get work.

IMPORTANT: For each job, you MUST create a detailed summary that is EXACTLY 6-8 sentences long. 

- Don't make all jobs sound the same!**
- Preserve specific phrases that detail the nature of the work.
- Maintain their exact pay ranges, bonuses, and incentives as stated

These elements are also very relevant to our job seekers and should be included IF there is actual text from the ad that mentions them:
1) What the job role entails and main duties (using their language)
2) Pay/benefits offered (their exact wording and specific numbers)
3) Route and schedule information (preserve their exact terms: "home daily", "out 5 days", "weekends off", specific routes, territories, etc.)
4) Physical demands of the job (mention if it's "no-touch freight", requires loading/unloading, heavy lifting, dock work, etc.)
5) Key requirements and qualifications (including criminal background requirements if mentioned)
7) Any training provided or growth opportunities (their exact promises)

Don't standardize everything - each company should sound different! 

**IMPORTANT DETAILS TO PRESERVE WHEN PRESENT:**
- Route information
- Schedule details
- Physical demands

If criminal background requirements are actually mentioned, include them clearly using the company's exact language when possible.

**CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS - USE EXACT VALUES ONLY:**

**FAIR CHANCE CLASSIFICATION (fair_chance field):**
- "fair_chance_employer": Fair chance employer - welcomes applicants with criminal records
- "background_check_required": Background check required - may disqualify applicants with records
- "clean_record_required": Clean driving/criminal record explicitly required
- "no_requirements_mentioned": No background check requirements mentioned

**ENDORSEMENT CLASSIFICATION (endorsements field):**
- "none_required": No special CDL endorsements required
- "hazmat": Hazmat endorsement required
- "passenger": Passenger endorsement required
- "school_bus": School bus endorsement required
- "tanker": Tanker endorsement required
- "double_triple": Double/Triple trailer endorsement required
- "combination": Multiple endorsements required

**CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
1. Use ONLY the exact values listed above
2. For fair_chance: Look for explicit policies about criminal records/background checks
3. For endorsements: Look for REQUIRED CDL endorsements (not preferred or helpful)
4. If unclear or not mentioned, use appropriate default values
5. Be conservative - only classify as fair_chance_employer if explicitly stated

**EXAMPLES:**
- "We welcome applicants with criminal records" ‚Üí fair_chance: "fair_chance_employer"
- "Clean criminal record required" or "no felonies" ‚Üí fair_chance: "clean_record_required"
- "Background check required" (criminal) ‚Üí fair_chance: "background_check_required"
- "Clean driving record required" ‚Üí fair_chance: "no_requirements_mentioned" (driving record ‚â† criminal background)
- No mention of background ‚Üí fair_chance: "no_requirements_mentioned"
- "Hazmat endorsement required" ‚Üí endorsements: "hazmat"
- "No special endorsements needed" ‚Üí endorsements: "none_required"

**LOCATION TRANSLATION:**
If the job location is in a non-English language, translate it to English and normalize to standard US format.
Examples:
- "„Ç¢„É°„É™„Ç´ÂêàË°ÜÂõΩ Nevada, „Éú„Éº„É´„ÉÄ„Éº„Éª„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Boulder City, NV"

FreeWorld is a non-profit that helps Americans with low incomes get living wage jobs in the trucking industry.
We send them to trucking school where they earn a CDL-A, which qualifies them to drive CDL-B jobs as well. They are trained on air brakes, combination vehicles (pulling trailers), and manual transmissions. Many have endorsements such as Hazmat, Airbrakes, Passenger, and Tanker. FreeWorld helps candidates obtain these endorsements if needed.
Most have no previous professional driving experience, no personal vehicle, and limited access to professional equipment. Many have criminal records ‚Äî ranging from misdemeanors to older or non-violent felonies. Our candidates know how to operate tractor-trailers, and are ready to work.

We want to help connect them to jobs they have a strong chance of getting if they show up prepared, knowledgeable, and ready to demonstrate their skills in a road test. Assume they are ready to work ‚Äî but must be hired into a role that does not require prior CDL driving experience or their own equipment.

**CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY SYSTEM:**

1. **RELEVANCE IS KING**: CDL driving jobs are the top priority. A CDL job with no experience requirements is always GOOD. CDL B OR A, just fine. DO NOT EXCLUDE CDL-B, or CLASS B CDL JOBS!

2. **EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS** (the main filter) Good/So-So/Bad:
Jobs should be classified as **so-so** if they:
- Prefer experience but do not require it (unless there's a strong signal actively seeking new drivers)
- Are non-CDL jobs or explicitly state "No CDL required" - these are backup options but not ideal for CDL holders
- Have unclear requirements or mixed signals about experience needs
- Are delivery/warehouse jobs that don't utilize CDL training

Jobs should be classified as **good** if they:
- Explicitly welcome new CDL drivers or state "no experience required"
- Provide training
- Are CDL-required positions that actively recruit entry-level drivers
- Have clear entry-level pathways

Jobs should be classified as **bad** if they:
- Require ANY amount of truck driving experience, even one day. Our candidates know how to drive and hold CDLs, but they have no CDL or driving work history AT ALL

3. **AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIERS**:
   - Owner-operator/1099 (must own truck/trailer) ‚Üí BAD
   - School bus driving ‚Üí BAD  
   - Requires "no felonies AND no misdemeanors" combined ‚Üí BAD

**ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
FreeWorld candidates have CDL-A with basic training on air brakes, combination vehicles, and manual transmissions. ENDORSEMENTS ARE NOT A BARRIER. FreeWorld helps Free Agents get ANY endorsement they need to get work.

IMPORTANT: For each job, you MUST create a detailed summary that is EXACTLY 6-8 sentences long. 

- Don't make all jobs sound the same!**
- Preserve specific phrases that detail the nature of the work.
- Maintain their exact pay ranges, bonuses, and incentives as stated

These elements are also very relevant to our job seekers and should be included IF there is actual text from the ad that mentions them:
1) What the job role entails and main duties (using their language)
2) Pay/benefits offered (their exact wording and specific numbers)
3) Route and schedule information (preserve their exact terms: "home daily", "out 5 days", "weekends off", specific routes, territories, etc.)
4) Physical demands of the job (mention if it's "no-touch freight", requires loading/unloading, heavy lifting, dock work, etc.)
5) Key requirements and qualifications (including criminal background requirements if mentioned)
7) Any training provided or growth opportunities (their exact promises)

Don't standardize everything - each company should sound different! 

**IMPORTANT DETAILS TO PRESERVE WHEN PRESENT:**
- Route information
- Schedule details
- Physical demands

If criminal background requirements are actually mentioned, include them clearly using the company's exact language when possible.

**CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS - USE EXACT VALUES ONLY:**

**FAIR CHANCE CLASSIFICATION (fair_chance field):**
- "fair_chance_employer": Fair chance employer - welcomes applicants with criminal records
- "background_check_required": Background check required - may disqualify applicants with records
- "clean_record_required": Clean driving/criminal record explicitly required
- "no_requirements_mentioned": No background check requirements mentioned

**ENDORSEMENT CLASSIFICATION (endorsements field):**
- "none_required": No special CDL endorsements required
- "hazmat": Hazmat endorsement required
- "passenger": Passenger endorsement required
- "school_bus": School bus endorsement required
- "tanker": Tanker endorsement required
- "double_triple": Double/Triple trailer endorsement required
- "combination": Multiple endorsements required

**CLASSIFICATION RULES:**
1. Use ONLY the exact values listed above
2. For fair_chance: Look for explicit policies about criminal records/background checks
3. For endorsements: Look for REQUIRED CDL endorsements (not preferred or helpful)
4. If unclear or not mentioned, use appropriate default values
5. Be conservative - only classify as fair_chance_employer if explicitly stated

**EXAMPLES:**
- "We welcome applicants with criminal records" ‚Üí fair_chance: "fair_chance_employer"
- "Clean criminal record required" or "no felonies" ‚Üí fair_chance: "clean_record_required"
- "Background check required" (criminal) ‚Üí fair_chance: "background_check_required"
- "Clean driving record required" ‚Üí fair_chance: "no_requirements_mentioned" (driving record ‚â† criminal background)
- No mention of background ‚Üí fair_chance: "no_requirements_mentioned"
- "Hazmat endorsement required" ‚Üí endorsements: "hazmat"
- "No special endorsements needed" ‚Üí endorsements: "none_required"

**LOCATION TRANSLATION:**
If the job location is in a non-English language, translate it to English and normalize to standard US format.
Examples:
- "„Ç¢„É°„É™„Ç´ÂêàË°ÜÂõΩ Nevada, „Éú„Éº„É´„ÉÄ„Éº„Éª„Ç∑„ÉÜ„Ç£" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Boulder City, NV"
- "„Ç´„É™„Éï„Ç©„É´„Éã„Ç¢Â∑û„É≠„Çµ„É≥„Çº„É´„Çπ" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Los Angeles, CA"
- "Texas, Houston" ‚Üí normalized_location: "Houston, TX"
- Always use standard US state abbreviations (CA, TX, NV, etc.)
- Format: "City, STATE" or "City, County, STATE" for clarity
