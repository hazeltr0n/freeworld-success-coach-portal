# ENTIRE FILE COMMENTED OUT FOR TESTING
# This file is not imported by the main application (app.py, pipeline_wrapper.py, pipeline_v3.py)
# Only used in test files - commenting out to verify it's not needed for production

# Original content was 125 lines of PDF generation wrappers
# If PDFs still work without this file, we can remove it entirely
