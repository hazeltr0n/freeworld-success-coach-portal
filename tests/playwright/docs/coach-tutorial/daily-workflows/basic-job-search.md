# Basic Job Search

This is the most common workflow for finding jobs for Free Agents.

## Step 1: Navigate to Job Search

1. Click the **üîç Job Search** tab in the main navigation
2. The search interface will load with parameter forms

## Step 2: Set Search Parameters

### Essential Parameters:
1. **Location**: Enter target city and state (e.g., "Houston, TX")
2. **Search Terms**: Enter relevant job keywords (e.g., "CDL driver")
3. **Job Quantity**: Select appropriate search size:
   - Start with "25 jobs (test)" for new locations
   - Use "100 jobs (sample)" for standard searches
   - Only use larger sizes for comprehensive market analysis

### Optional Parameters:
- **Classifier Type**: Choose based on job type:
  - "CDL Traditional" for driving jobs
  - "Career Pathways" for warehouse/progression jobs

## Step 3: Choose Search Mode

### Start with Memory Only (Recommended)
1. Click **üíæ Memory Only** button first
2. Results appear in 2-5 seconds if location was recently searched
3. No API cost, very fast results
4. Shows jobs from last 72 hours of searches

### Use Fresh Search if Needed
1. If Memory Only returns few/no results, use **üîç Indeed Fresh Only**
2. Takes 30-90 seconds but gets latest job postings
3. Uses API credits but provides fresh data
4. Best for new locations or when memory is stale

## Step 4: Review Results

### Results Display Includes:
- **Total Jobs Found**: Number at top of results
- **Quality Distribution**: Good/So-So/Bad breakdown
- **Route Distribution**: Local vs OTR breakdown
- **Job Listings**: Individual job details with ratings

### Quality Indicators:
- üü¢ **Good**: High-quality matches (target these)
- üü° **So-So**: Acceptable options (review carefully)
- üü• **Bad**: Avoid recommending these

## Step 5: Export Results (Optional)

1. Scroll to bottom of results
2. Configure PDF export options:
   - Maximum jobs to include
   - Quality levels to include
   - Route types to include
3. Click **Generate PDF Report**
4. PDF downloads with professional formatting

## Best Practices

### For Efficient Searches:
1. **Always try Memory Only first** - saves time and money
2. **Start small** - use 25 jobs to test new locations
3. **Use specific search terms** - "CDL driver" vs generic "driver"
4. **Check multiple nearby cities** if one returns few results

### For Quality Results:
1. **Focus on Good ratings** - these meet Free Agent needs best
2. **Review So-So jobs carefully** - may work for right candidate
3. **Avoid Bad jobs** - waste of time and hurt coach credibility
4. **Note Fair Chance indicators** - critical for many Free Agents

### Time-Saving Tips:
1. **Reuse successful parameters** - system remembers your settings
2. **Set up batch searches** for regular markets (if you have permission)
3. **Use analytics** to see which searches perform best
4. **Keep notes** on what works in each market

## Common Issues

**No results found?**
- Try broader search terms ("driver" instead of "CDL Class A driver")
- Test nearby cities ("Austin, TX" if "San Antonio, TX" fails)
- Switch to Indeed Fresh if Memory Only is empty

**Results taking too long?**
- Use smaller job quantity (25 instead of 100+)
- Check internet connection
- Try during off-peak hours

**Too many Bad jobs?**
- Adjust search terms to be more specific
- Try different classifier type
- Consider different location with better job market
