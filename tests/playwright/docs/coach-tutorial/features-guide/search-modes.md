# Search Modes & Types

Understanding when and how to use different search modes is key to efficient job searching.

## Search Modes

### 💾 Memory Only Search

**What it does**: Searches jobs cached from recent API calls (last 72 hours)

**Advantages**:
- ⚡ **Very Fast**: Results in 2-5 seconds
- 💰 **No Cost**: Uses cached data, no API charges
- 🔄 **Consistent**: Same results for repeated searches
- 🧠 **Smart Caching**: Automatically stores searches from all coaches

**When to Use**:
- Repeat searches in same location
- Quick results needed for client meetings
- Testing search parameters
- Cost-conscious searching
- Follow-up searches after initial fresh search

**Limitations**:
- Only returns results if location searched recently (72 hours)
- May miss newest job postings
- Limited to previously searched terms and locations

### 🔍 Indeed Fresh Only

**What it does**: Searches fresh jobs directly from Indeed API

**Advantages**:
- 🆕 **Latest Jobs**: Gets newest postings from Indeed
- 🌍 **Any Location**: Works for any US location
- 📈 **Complete Results**: Full job market coverage
- 🎯 **Custom Terms**: Search any keywords you specify

**When to Use**:
- New locations not recently searched
- Need absolutely latest job postings
- Memory search returns insufficient results (< 20 jobs)
- Exploring new markets
- Client needs comprehensive market analysis

**Considerations**:
- ⏱️ **Slower**: Takes 30-90 seconds to complete
- 💵 **API Cost**: Uses Indeed API credits
- 📊 **Rate Limited**: Limited searches per day
- 🔄 **Variable**: Results may vary between searches

## Search Strategy Recommendations

### Optimal Search Flow:
1. **Start with Memory Only** for any location
2. **Evaluate results** - if 20+ good jobs, you're done
3. **Use Indeed Fresh** if Memory returns < 20 jobs
4. **Memory will cache** Fresh results for future use

### Cost-Effective Approach:
- Use Memory Only 80% of the time
- Reserve Fresh searches for new markets or when memory is insufficient
- Set up batch schedules for regular markets to keep memory fresh

### Time-Efficient Approach:
- Always try Memory Only first (5 seconds vs 90 seconds)
- Use Fresh only when necessary
- Remember that Fresh results get cached for future Memory searches
